    <h4>About Us</h4>
    Cerberus is built around friends who have jobs, school, families, and real life commitments, but who still want to kill pixel dragons, liches, and demons together. This means we expect our players to come to raids prepared with gear, consumables, and knowledge of the fights so that we can clear content efficiently in the limited time available.
We are currently running 8 Karazhan groups (clearing through NB), and 3x 25-mans (clearing gruul and mag). Loot system is currently SR for leveling group chaos but will transition to EPGP at the beginning of P2.

Team Details and Needs: Team Chimera Sat/Sun 7-11PM Server Time.

Team Phoenix Weds/Thurs 8-11PM Server Time.

Team Unicorn Weds/Thurs 8-11PM Server Time.

All exceptional applicants will be considered regardless of current need.

Our expectations of new members: * Effective Communication: fluency in English, Discord, a mic, ability to receive and give constructive criticism. * Raid Preparation as needed: obtain at least pre-raid BiS and resist sets, consumables, and knowledge of the encounters. * Able to reliably attend the 2 raid nights per week.
